# Radon
Minecraft Bedrock &amp; Java Cross Compatibility Software

# Why use Radon?
Radon is a Bedrock based server, making it use less resources and run a lot faster.
Radon automatically detects and interprets Minecraft Java player packets so both editions of the game are capable of joining.
This project is 100% open source.
The Radon project will continued to be worked on, so it will improve over time.
It is incredibly easy to write plugins for Radon because it is written in Python.
