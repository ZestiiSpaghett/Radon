# Radon
Minecraft Bedrock &amp; Java Cross Compatibility Software

# Why use Radon?
Radon is a Bedrock based server, making it use less resources and run a lot faster.
Radon automatically detects and interprets Minecraft Java player packets so both editions of the game are capable of joining.
This project is 100% open source.
The Radon project will continued to be worked on, so it will improve over time.
